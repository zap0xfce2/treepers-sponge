## Description
Tired of cleaning up the result of a Creeper meeting an unalert player? Want to save your precioussSSsssSssSS things? But still want to make encountering these creatures remarkable?

**Treepers** not only stops the destructive behaviour of a Creeper's explosion, but grows a **tree** to remember him! If you want you can set the TREEPER_CHANCE in the config so that Treepers and Creepers can appear. The default chance is 50/50.

The type of tree grown is determined by the current biome.
